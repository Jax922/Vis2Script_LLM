Script:
"As we embark on a historical journey through 'Oldtown', a city steeped in medieval charm, we'll examine the tourist trends from 1995 to 2020. Our graph, with its x-axis marking the years, tells a story of fluctuating yet generally increasing tourist visits.

Starting in 1995 with 100,000 visitors, we see a steady increase, reflecting Oldtown's growing popularity among history enthusiasts and travelers. Each subsequent year marks a rise in the number of tourists, with 2019 reaching a peak of 220,000 visitors.

However, the year 2020 paints a different picture, showing a dramatic drop to just 50,000 visitors, a direct consequence of the global travel restrictions. This sudden decline not only impacted Oldtown's tourism industry but also served as a stark reminder of the city's reliance on global connectivity and travel."
