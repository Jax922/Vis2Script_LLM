Script:"Today, let's delve into the remarkable economic transformation of China over the past two centuries. We begin our journey in 1800, where the per capita income stood at $985, a humble figure reflecting the era's economic conditions. As we move along our timeline, represented by the x-axis, we witness a slow yet steady growth through the 20th century, reaching $1,016 by 1970.
The real momentum, however, starts in the 1980s. Here, we observe a significant leap, with the income per capita hitting $3,000 by 1990. This period marks a pivotal shift in China's economic policies and global engagement.
Entering the 21st century, the pace accelerates dramatically. By 2015, we reach a peak of $13,334, a testament to China's rapid industrialization and emergence as a global economic powerhouse. This graph not only charts economic figures but narrates a story of development, resilience, and ambition that reshaped the global economic landscape."
