Script:
"Join us in examining the growth of 'Green Farm', a pioneer in sustainable agriculture, through their annual organic vegetable production from 2005 to 2020. The x-axis of our chart takes us on a journey of increasing green yields, a testament to the farm's commitment to the environment.

Beginning with a modest 100 tons in 2005, 'Green Farm' steadily expanded its production, adapting innovative organic farming techniques. The year 2015 marks a significant leap, with production doubling to 500 tons, following the farm's expansion and increased demand for organic produce.

While there's a slight tapering off in production post-2015, the farm consistently maintained high output levels, reinforcing its role as a key player in the organic food market. This chart is not just about agricultural output; it reflects a broader trend towards sustainable living and responsible farming practices."
