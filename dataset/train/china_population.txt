Script:"Let's take a journey through time, observing the remarkable growth of China's population from 1800 to 2015. Our story begins in the 19th century, with a population of over 321 million in 1800, reflecting the vastness of China even in historical times.
As we progress along the x-axis of our graph, we see a gradual increase through the 1800s and early 1900s, despite historical upheavals. The real surge, however, begins around the mid-20th century. Post-1950, there's a notable acceleration, with the population climbing from around 544 million to over a billion by the turn of the century.
By 2015, the population reaches an astounding 1.37 billion. This graph not only shows numbers but tells a story of societal changes, economic development, and urbanization in modern China."
